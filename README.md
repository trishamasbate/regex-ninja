## 📃 Description:

In this tutorial, we'll explore a simple regex pattern designed to match hex values, typically used for color codes in web development. We’ll break down each component: the # symbol, the character classes for matching digits and letters, and the quantifiers that allow for both 3 and 6 character hex codes. By the end, you'll understand how each part of this regex contributes to accurately identifying valid hex values.
